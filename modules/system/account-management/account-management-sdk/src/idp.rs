//! `IdP` tenant-provisioning contract.
//!
//! Public contract that deployment-specific `IdP` plugins implement and
//! that AM consumes through `ClientHub`. The trait carries three
//! methods — [`IdpTenantProvisionerClient::check_availability`],
//! [`IdpTenantProvisionerClient::provision_tenant`], and
//! [`IdpTenantProvisionerClient::deprovision_tenant`] (the last has a
//! default impl returning [`DeprovisionFailure::UnsupportedOperation`])
//! — together with the request / result / failure shapes they exchange.
//!
//! The trait runs **outside** any database transaction — the
//! provisioning step is an external side effect that must not hold
//! locks in `tenants`.
//!
//! # Failure model
//!
//! The `Ok` variant of `provision_tenant` carries optional metadata
//! produced by the provider, which AM persists alongside the `active`
//! status flip. The `Err` variant is a [`ProvisionFailure`]
//! discriminating between:
//!
//! * [`ProvisionFailure::CleanFailure`] — AM can prove no `IdP`-side
//!   state was retained (connection refused before send, 4xx from the
//!   provider with a contract-defined "nothing retained" semantic).
//!   AM runs the compensating TX, deletes the `provisioning` row, and
//!   surfaces an AIP-193 `ServiceUnavailable` (HTTP 503).
//! * [`ProvisionFailure::Ambiguous`] — transport failure / timeout /
//!   5xx where the provider may or may not have retained state. AM
//!   leaves the `provisioning` row for the provisioning reaper to
//!   compensate asynchronously and surfaces `Internal` (HTTP 500). Not
//!   retry-safe without reconciliation.
//! * [`ProvisionFailure::UnsupportedOperation`] — the provider
//!   signalled that the requested provisioning cannot be performed at
//!   all. AM surfaces `Unimplemented` (HTTP 501); compensation rules
//!   match the `CleanFailure` path (nothing was ever written
//!   provider-side).
//!
//! The `provider_detail` strings carried by the failure variants are
//! routed through AM's redaction pipeline before reaching public
//! envelopes (see the impl-side `From<ProvisionFailure>
//! for DomainError` boundary in `cyberware-account-management::domain::idp`).
//! Plugin authors do not need to redact themselves — they pass the
//! raw vendor text and AM owns the public-surface mapping.
