//! Uniform single-flight gate for the hierarchy-integrity check.
//!
//! Both backends (`Postgres` + `SQLite`) coordinate via a primary-key
//! INSERT into `integrity_check_runs`. The PK is a synthetic singleton
//! (`id = 1`, enforced by a CHECK constraint) so the table holds at
//! most one row at a time: a second worker attempting to insert
//! receives a unique-violation, which this module maps to
//! [`DomainError::IntegrityCheckInProgress`]. The `Postgres`
//! `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` path used by the legacy raw-SQL
//! integrity check is intentionally not reintroduced — uniform
//! behaviour across backends is the whole point of the Rust-side
//! refactor.
//!
//! ## Three-transaction lifecycle (per-call)
//!
//! The acquire INSERT and release DELETE run in their own short,
//! committed transactions, separate from the snapshot/work
//! transaction in between. This makes the lock row visible to
//! contenders for the duration of the check: a concurrent worker
//! attempting [`acquire_committed`] sees the committed row and
//! surfaces [`DomainError::IntegrityCheckInProgress`] instead of
//! queueing on the uncommitted PK and then succeeding after the
//! original transaction commits its INSERT+DELETE pair — the
//! same-tx INSERT+DELETE pattern was the way contender races used
//! to silently degrade into redundant runs.
//!
//! ## Stale-lock cleanup
//!
//! The acquire path deletes any row whose `started_at` is older than
//! [`MAX_LOCK_AGE`] before inserting its own row. This is intentional:
//! stale rows are by construction crashed workers, so reclaiming them
//! eagerly during any acquire keeps the table size bounded without
//! needing a separate sweeper. There is no separate periodic sweeper
//! because every `acquire_committed` call already runs the cleanup.
//!
//! ## Tx-level helpers
//!
//! [`acquire`] / [`release`] operate inside an existing
//! `DbTx<'_>` and remain available for tests; production code paths
//! use [`acquire_committed`] / [`release_committed`].
//!
//! ## Interim implementation -- multi-replica safety gap (tracked)
//!
//! This module is an **interim** singleton-lock primitive. It is
//! sufficient to keep one worker at a time on a single-replica
//! deployment and to short-circuit a peer that is already running,
//! but it is NOT sufficient to keep multi-replica AM safe under the
//! full failure model the integrity reconciler must survive:
//!
//! * **No fence token / fence-in-tx.** A VM-suspended replica whose
//!   lock row's TTL expires can be superseded by a peer that takes
//!   over the gate; when the suspended replica thaws, its in-flight
//!   repair transaction can still commit because the repair tx and
//!   the lock row are validated independently. Two replicas can then
//!   end up writing to `tenants` / `tenant_closure` against
//!   different snapshots, which is exactly the "double-correction"
//!   class of bug the integrity reconciler exists to prevent.
//! * **No renewal heartbeat with explicit lease-loss signal.** Long
//!   classify-then-repair cycles ([`MAX_LOCK_AGE`] is the only
//!   safety net) cannot extend the lease, and the worker has no
//!   in-band way to learn that it has been replaced.
//! * **No forensic `attempts` counter.** Crash-takeover patterns
//!   ("the same hierarchy keeps killing the worker") are invisible
//!   to operators because every takeover looks like a fresh run.
//!
//! The chosen replacement is the `modkit-coord` library
//! (`LeaseManager::acquire` + `Guard::spawn_renewal` +
//! `Guard::with_ack_in_tx`), which co-locates lease validation and
//! repair writes in the same SQL transaction and therefore makes
//! "I lost the lease while writing" an atomic rollback rather than
//! a silent data corruption. The fence-in-tx pattern is correct
//! only when the lease and the repair targets share a transaction
//! boundary, which is why `modkit-coord` mandates same-DB lease
//! storage.
//!
//! Migration is tracked in
//! <https://github.com/cyberfabric/cyberware-rust/issues/1873>.
//! Until that lands, AM ships single-replica or warns operators on
//! multi-replica deployments via the loop's
//! `RUNS{outcome=skipped_in_progress}` metric -- which today fires
//! on the contender path but does NOT discriminate "peer is
//! healthy" from "peer is wedged with a still-valid TTL".
