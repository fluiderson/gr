//! [`BootstrapService`] — orchestrates the platform-bootstrap saga.
//!
//! Implements FEATURE `platform-bootstrap` (see
//! `modules/system/account-management/docs/features/feature-platform-bootstrap.md`).
//!
//! The saga has three observable phases (FEATURE §3):
//!
//! 1. **Idempotency classification** — `find_by_id(root_id)` drives the
//!    branch decision. Active root → no-op skip; Provisioning root →
//!    defer to the provisioning reaper without re-running `IdP`;
//!    Suspended/Deleted root → fail-fast `Internal` (illegal
//!    pre-existing state — operator intervention required); no row →
//!    fresh insert.
//! 2. **`IdP` wait with backoff** — implemented via non-mutating
//!    `check_availability` probes before saga state is written. A
//!    `ProvisionFailure::CleanFailure` during the actual provision call
//!    while the deadline still has budget reschedules the saga after
//!    compensating; the bootstrap deadline (`idp_wait_timeout_secs`) is
//!    the wall-clock cap. Backoff doubles from
//!    `idp_retry_backoff_initial_secs` up to
//!    `idp_retry_backoff_max_secs` per FEATURE §3.
//! 3. **Finalization** — single short transaction that flips the root
//!    row from `Provisioning` to `Active` and writes the self-row in
//!    `tenant_closure` via `TenantRepo::activate_tenant` (closure
//!    helpers in [`crate::domain::tenant::closure`]).
//!
//! Compensation rules per FEATURE §3 `algo-platform-bootstrap-finalization-saga`:
//!
//! * `ProvisionFailure::CleanFailure` → delete the provisioning row and
//!   surface `idp_unavailable` (retry-safe).
//! * `ProvisionFailure::Ambiguous` → leave the provisioning row in
//!   place for the reaper; surface `Internal` (NOT retry-safe).
//! * `ProvisionFailure::UnsupportedOperation` → delete the provisioning
//!   row and surface `idp_unsupported_operation`.
